# Maze Run VR

This is less of a game or experience, and more of an experiment. The goal was
to be able to take a tile-map creating using a progam like
[Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/), and use it to generate a 3D mazes that
could be traversed in VR.

At this point, the proof-of-concept is "working", but it's a bit messy and
there's plenty that could be done to clean things up.
